# Enabling Https with Nginx

When using HTTPS, traffic from and to Seafile Server is encrypted. HTTPS requires a SSL certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).

For production use, HTTPS is imperative. 

Unless you already have a SSL certificate, we recommend that you get your SSL certificate from [Letâ€™s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). If you have a SSL certificate from another CA, skip the section "Getting a Let's Encrypt certificate".

## Setup

The configuration of Seafile behind Nginx as a reverse proxy is demonstrated using the sample host name `seafile.example.com`. 

These instructions assume the following requirements:

* Seafile Server Community Edition/Professional Edition and [Nginx](deploy_with_nginx.md) were set up according to the instructions in this manual
* A host name points at the IP address of the server and the server is available on port 80 and 443

If your setup differs from thes requirements, adjust the following instructions accordingly.

### Getting a Let's Encrypt certificate

Getting a Let's Encrypt certificate is straightforward thanks to [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). Certbot is a free, open source software tool for requesting, receiving, and renewing Let's Encrypt certificates.

First, go to the [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) website and choose your webserver and OS.

Second, follow the detailed instructions then shown.

We recommend that you get just a certificate and that you modify the Nginx configuration yourself:

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --nginx
```

Follow the instructions on the screen.

Upon successful verification, Certbot saves the certificate files in a directory named after the host name in  ```/etc/letsencrypt/live```. For the host name seafile.example.com, the files are stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/seafile.example.com`. 

### Enabling SSL module of Nginx (optional)

If your Nginx does not support SSL, you need to recompile it. Use the following command:

```bash
    ./configure --with-http_stub_status_module --with-http_ssl_module
    make && make install
```

### Modifying Nginx configuration file

Add an  server block for port 443 and a http-to-https redirect to the `seafile.conf` configuration file in `/etc/nginx`.  

This is a (shortened) sample configuration for the host name seafile.example.com:

```nginx
log_format seafileformat '$http_x_forwarded_for $remote_addr [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" $upstream_response_time';

server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  seafile.example.com;
    rewrite ^ https://$http_host$request_uri? permanent;	# Forced redirect from HTTP to HTTPS

    server_tokens off;		# Prevents the Nginx version from being displayed in the HTTP response header
}

server {
    listen 443;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/seafile.example.com/fullchain.pem;    # Path to your fullchain.pem
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/seafile.example.com/privkey.pem;	# Path to your privkey.pem
    server_name seafile.example.com;
    server_tokens off;
    
    location / {
    	proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    	proxy_set_header   Host $host;
    	proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    	proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    	proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
    	proxy_read_timeout 1200s;
    
    	proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto https;

... # No changes beyond this point compared to the Nginx configuration without HTTPS

```

Finally, make sure your seafile.conf does not contain syntax errors and restart Nginx for the configuration changes to take effect:

```
nginx -t
nginx -s reload
```

### Large file uploads

Tip for uploading very large files (> 4GB): By default Nginx will buffer large request body in temp file. After the body is completely received, Nginx will send the body to the upstream server (seaf-server in our case). But it seems when file size is very large, the buffering mechanism dosen't work well. It may stop proxying the body in the middle. So if you want to support file upload larger for 4GB, we suggest you install Nginx version >= 1.8.0 and add the following options to Nginx config file:

```nginx
    location /seafhttp {
        ... ...
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }

```

If you have WebDAV enabled it is recommended to add the same:

```nginx
    location /seafdav {
        ... ...
        proxy_request_buffering off;
    }
```

### Modifying ccnet.conf

Modify the `SERVICE_URL` in [ccnet.conf](../config/ccnet-conf.md) to account for the switch from HTTP to HTTPS. 

```bash
SERVICE_URL = https://seafile.example.com
```

Note: The`SERVICE_URL` can also be modified in Seahub via System Admininstration > Settings.  If `SERVICE_URL` is configured via System Admin and in ccnet.conf, the value in System Admin will take precedence.

### Modifying seahub_settings.py

Modify the `FILE_SERVER_ROOT` in [seahub_settings.py](../config/seahub_settings_py/) to account for the switch from HTTP to HTTPS.

```python
FILE_SERVER_ROOT = 'https://seafile.example.com/seafhttp'
```

Note: The`FILE_SERVER_ROOT` can also be modified in Seahub via System Admininstration > Settings.  If `FILE_SERVER_ROOT` is configured via System Admin and in seahub_settings.py, the value in System Admin will take precedence.

### Starting Seafile and Seahub

Restart the seaf-server and Seahub for the config changes to take effect:

```bash
su seafile
cd /opt/seafile/seafile-server-latest
./seafile.sh restart
./seahub.sh restart # or "./seahub.sh start-fastcgi" if you're using fastcgi
```

## Additional modern settings for Nginx (optional)

### Activating IPv6

Require IPv6 on server otherwise the server will not start! Also the AAAA dns record is required for IPv6 usage.

```nginx
listen 443;
listen [::]:443;
```

### Activating HTTP2

Activate HTTP2 for more performance. Only available for SSL and nginx version>=1.9.5. Simply add `http2`.
```nginx
listen 443 http2;
listen [::]:443 http2;
```

## Advanced TLS configuration for Nginx (optional)

The TLS configuration in the sample Nginx configuration file above receives a B overall rating on [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). By modifying the TLS configuration in `seafile.conf `,  this rating can be significantly improved. 

The following sample Nginx configuration file for the host name seafile.example.com contains additional security-related directives . (Note that this sample file uses a generic path for the SSL certificate files.) Some of the directives require further steps as explained below.

```nginx
    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  seafile.example.com;
        rewrite ^ https://$http_host$request_uri? permanent;	# Forced redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
        server_tokens off;
    }
    server {
        listen 443;
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cacert.pem;        # Path to your cacert.pem
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/privkey.pem;	# Path to your privkey.pem
        server_name seafile.example.com;
        server_tokens off;

        # HSTS for protection against man-in-the-middle-attacks
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
    
        # DH parameters for Diffie-Hellman key exchange
        ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem;

        # Supported protocols and ciphers for general purpose server with good security and compatability with most clients

        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;

            root /home/user/haiwen/seafile-server-latest/seahub;
        }
    }
```

### Enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security

Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to prevent man-in-the-middle-attacks by adding this directive:

```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

HSTS instructs web browsers to automatically use HTTPS. That means, after the first visit of the HTTPS version of Seahub, the browser will only use https to access the site.

### Using Perfect Forward Secrecy

Enable Diffie-Hellman (DH) key-exchange. Generate DH parameters and write them in a .pem file using the following command:

```bash
openssl dhparam 2048 > /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem  # Generates DH parameter of length 2048 bits
```

The generation of the the DH parameters may take some time depending on the server's processing power.

Add the following directive in the HTTPS server block:

```
ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/dhparam.pem;
```

### Restricting TLS protocols and ciphers

Disallow the use of old TLS protocols and cipher. Mozilla provides a configuration generator for optimizing the conflicting objectives of security and compabitility. Visit https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Nginx for more Information.
